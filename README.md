Maybe a possible to solution to problems like this could consist of clamAV antivirus scanning of data moving from ISP node to node or even Cellular Tower node to node so the ISP can track websites with problematic virus problems, similar to collecting data with cellular phone mesh networks.
	Since data has to travel each way from the customer sending and receiving data to and from the ISPs this data can be scanned on the fly using clamAV to narrow down on the attack vector of internet based viruses.
	Where individual ISP connections could be suspended from the receiving local ISP node to the customer. The key is to really differentiate between false positives like malware test files, and the possibilities of non destructive virus signatures which might consist of key-loggers being used for legitimate user tracking or other type of virus testing by security domains within a small network of computers or singular computer system. 
	Most viruses being detected, 90% of the time are not false positives or non destructive viruses when it consists of it being in the domain of a Trojan or a RAT typed virus.

	  <p> A snort based google lens would cut down on dating scams by detecting image data as it travels, if snort or suricata implemented a type of "google lens" plugin to detect image data as it travels from node to node. Pfsense already has snort or suricata which can detect signatures from Tor, bittorrent and other app id signatures.
